1. Overburden material is composed of 1.5 to 2 m thick layer of porous insitu soil underlain by loosely packed and friable sandstone which has
undergone extensive weathering (W3 – W4) as observed in the landslide
scarp. Heavy downpour resulted in over-saturation of this weak and
porous slope forming material, which contributed to the driving force by
development of pore water pressure.
2. Thin layer of hard compacted sandstone (~ 0.5 cm) intercalated between
the weathered friable sandstone is noted to be dipping towards the
valley. Thus, this valley dipping bed may also have acted as a slip
surface for the saturated overburden material to slide along the interface.
3. Slope failure is also contributed by concentrated flow of surface water
runoff as it incises into the affected slope face and create temporary
channel on slope (Figure 2).
4. Carving out spaces along toe of slope for house construction greatly
contributes to instability of slope. The toe portion of slope has been cut
at a near vertical angle of about 4 feet high which further aggravated the
slope instability","1. Modification of existing slope to a gentler angle by slope dressing may

3. Locally available material can be used to contrive short term preventive
measures such as inserting hollow bamboo pipes into the slope to drain
out water; it may also be used to channel the surface water run-off away
from the problematic area.
4. Installing sturdy bamboo or tree trunk fence/ bio barriers between the
toe of slope and house may act as a barrier that will absorb the impact
and shield the house from the high energy down slope movement of
